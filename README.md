# Celebrity Image Recognition using CNN
The repository contains the code for Convolutional Neural Network model for Celebrity Image recognition.
The model is trained for recognising the  images of five main celebrities; Lionel Messi, Maria Sharapova, Roger Federer, Serena Williams and Virat Kohli. 
The dataset consisted of cropped images of celebrities and was saved in different folders for each individual. 
The data was preprocessed using various python libraries like NumPy, OpenCV and Tensorflow.
The training and evaluation results of the model are visualised using Matplotlib and are saved in the ‘Results’ folder.
The model is trained over 20 epochs with a batch size of 28, showing an increasing training accuracy and decreasing training loss.
Validation accuracy and loss are monitored during training to evaluate the model's generalization to new, unseen data. 
The accuracy plot is saved as ‘acuracy_plot.png’ and loss plot is saved as ‘loss_plot.png’ accordingly. 
The final evaluation results of the model are saved as a CSV file in the ‘Results’ folder as ‘Image_CNN.csv’. 
In order to use the code, the repository can be cloned and the ‘img_dir’ variable in the code should be adjusted and the instructions must be followed appropriately.
